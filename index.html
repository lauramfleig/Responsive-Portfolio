				<p class="bio-paragraph">
					I have been waiting years to become a professional at something other than serving people their food. In fact, I could probably make a tremendous portfolio with shining customer reviews of my ability to smile even when they're misbehaving. <br> <br>

					Despite my obvious love for the customer service industry, I am beyond thrilled to begin a new career in coding and web development. As a natural problem-solver, I am driven to find solutions to things that initially seem impossible. I have an eye for design, and am able to transfer my visions into reality. As a new developer, I am open to critique and willing to put energy into improving my knowledge and abilities.
